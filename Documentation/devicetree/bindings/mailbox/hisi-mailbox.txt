Hisilicon Mailbox Driver
========================

Hisilicon mailbox can support maximum 32 channels. Every channel supports
only one direction for data transferring, the maximum message data size is 8
bytes. For sending data, need set the register for channel's mode, and
trigger the interrupt for remote core. For receiving data, kernel will
handle interrupt and transfer data to mailbox framework.

Mailbox Device Node:
====================

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Shall be "hisilicon,hi6220-mbox"
- reg:			Contains the mailbox register address range (base
			address and length); the first item is for IPC
			registers, the second item is shared buffer for
			slots.
- #mbox-cells		Shall be 1 - the index of the channel needed.
- interrupts:		Contains the interrupt information for the mailbox
			device. The format is dependent on which interrupt
			controller the SoCs use.

Example:
--------

	mailbox: mailbox@F7510000 {
		#mbox-cells = <1>;
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi6220-mbox";
		reg = <0x0 0xF7510000 0x0 0x1000>, /* IPC_S */
		      <0x0 0x06DFF800 0x0 0x0800>; /* Mailbox */
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0 94 4>;
	};
